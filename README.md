# MaxLine-Feedback
Here's the place where you can report game bugs and request features

If your request is reasonable and it's suitable for the game, we'll consider whether to take your request and add it into the game

For bugs, you have to add the label "bug", or we'll close your report

For feature requests, you have to add the label "request", or we'll do the same

If we have taken your request, we will add the label "to-be-done" to your request. If we don't take it, we'll just close your request

If we have fixed the bug or finished the request, the original report will get the label "done" and get closed

Please follow our rules. The rules will be updated if there are some new things we have to say
